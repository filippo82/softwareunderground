## It all started...

...back in 2014, Duncan Child and Matt Hall started a Google Group
called Software Underground (sometimes affectionately referred to as Swung).
A little more than a year later, it branched out to Slack.
The move connected us much better, and it's where most of
the Software Underground action is today.

## Our purpose

> "To provide technical and professional development opportunities
to the global community of earth scientists and engineers who
program computers in the course of their work, and to promote
the use of open source digital technology in the exploitation
of natural resources and investigation of the earth."

## Who's involved

Software Underground is not an organization.
It is run and supported by Matt Hall, Evan Bianco, and
everyone at [Agile Scientific](https://agilescientific.com),
as well as by a core group of contributors
(including but not limited to Brendon Hall, Jesper Dramsch,
David Holmes, Steve Purves, and many others).

## Where else to find us

There are meatspace meetups from time to time, especially in Houston.
Look for #meetups in the Slack group.
