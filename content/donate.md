## Memberships and donations

Software Underground is not a formal organization.
Maybe it will be one day, but for now it's just a group of people,
distributed all over the world, that are connected through Slack
and through local meetups. The only expense is the Slack subscription
and this website, which are paid for by
[Agile Scientific](https://agilescientific.com).

If you'd like to contribute to this running cost in any way,
we're happy to have the help.
You can [subscribe](https://softwareunderground.org/subscribe)
to make a recurring donation, or make a one-time payment
[here](https://softwareunderground.org/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5c5b4c6f652deabe13d48883).
